- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andrew-Reeds
- 👀 I’m developing a programming language called GStonk. It is designed to be an intermediate language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that i need for that, because I actually don't know anything.
- 💞️ I love people... and programming.
- 📫 I have a YouTube channel that is kinda cringe, so I don't share it's link yet.
